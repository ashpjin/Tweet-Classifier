This directory was a result of multiple attempts to classify tweets using MALLET.

Generally, contains scripts, files, and notes for using MALLET to create an MaxEnt classifier on a set of training data and then classify new data. Classifier never worked completely due to insufficient training data. 

Also, contains some random files used for a webpage classifier if the MALLET had worked (e.g. /images, thankyou.html, etc.)

Known/Open Issues:
- requires smarter stemming
- requires more data
- should replace non-words like RT, usernames, and emoticons with a general indicator
- write script to do classifying instead of having "shortcuts" in a note file
