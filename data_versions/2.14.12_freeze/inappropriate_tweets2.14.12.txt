Having a tan makes me think it\'s
Summer. Then I look outside and there\'s snow. Mindfuck.,
You guys want to know how I know its spring already?? Cause my allergies are back ! :( #fuckallergies,
Me: d*** I feel like Winter. Is it even Spring yet? Sasha: Its Fall aint it? Lmaooo no b.tch! #Tweakin,
